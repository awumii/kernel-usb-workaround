# kernel-usb-workaround
A little program that looks for a malfunctioning usb bus and disables it. Temporary solution until i find the root cause in the Linux kernel.  
This issue is caused by faulty hardware, but the kernel does not handle this well, causing increased power usage and refusing to shutdown.  
If anyone knows how to properly patch the kernel instead please email me.
